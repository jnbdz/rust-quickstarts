# Simple | SMS | Twilio | Rust | Quickstarts
> NOTE: Twilio OpenAPI Spec is at the present in **BETA**. It is unsupported and under active development. For more details follow the link in the Resources section at the bottom of this README.

> With https://github.com/twilio/twilio-oai it is now possible to auto-generate your own Twilio client in your preferred programming language.

> For now Rust is not supported meaning it doesn't not have an official SDK. But with [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) you can auto-generate one for Rust.
